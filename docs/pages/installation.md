# ðŸ›³ Installation

Linux & macOS. Windows is not supported. If you have problems installing please open an issue :)

Autorestic requires `bash`, `wget` and `bzip2` to be installed. For most systems these should be already installed.

```bash
wget -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cseitz-forks/autorestic/master/install.sh | bash
```
